            <ul>
                <li>Data can be commissioned anonymously, but all data will eventually become public on the OCEAN blockchain.
                    Do not commission any confidential information via Leyline. Leyline will not be held accountable for the exposure
                    of confidential or illicit information by its users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since the data uploaded to Leyline is public-access, illicit material is not allowed.
                    Mild offenses such as copyright breaches will not be punished by law, but by the withholding of LEY tokens and potential account deactivation.
                    Major offenses such as uploading child pornography and revenge pornography will be traced down to your real identity, and the uploaders will be punished by the appropriate laws. 
                    Leyline, as a child of the OCEAN protocol, believes in transparency and integrity of data. See 
                    this page for legal guidelines when using LeyLine.

                    Leyline is a railroad which transfers the data you upload to the OCEAN blockchain.
